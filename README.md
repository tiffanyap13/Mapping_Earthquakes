# Mapping Earthquakes
The purpose of this assignment was to create an earthquake map, with three different tile layers, reflecting all earthquakes that occurred within the past 7 days, the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all of the earthquakes, with a magnitude greater than 4.5, that occurred within the past 7 days.
